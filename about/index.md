突破边界 创造价值

You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that these dots would connect down the road, would give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.
